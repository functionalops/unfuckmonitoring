== Unfuck Monitoring

A repository to catalog, define, and document useful metrics for monitoring.

The goals of this repository will be to produce some form of declaration of
metrics that can be selectively executed in a metrics collection agent.
Therefore we will need to define a format that various tools can implement.
We will attempt to find existing standards and formats to build on top of.

=== Objectives

To recap the objectives of this repository, we intend to:

* define metrics that would be helpful to be captured for a variety of
  distributed systems deployed in production today.
* describe what each metric offers in terms of visibility and benefit.
* note how we can capture each metric on each supported OS/Platform.
* limitations of the metric both from a conceptual and gathering
  implementation perspective.
* define a standardized format for metric gathering tools to support to
  build "executable" metrics gathering specifications.

=== Status

This is at the inception phase. Please be paitent while I get URLs, structure,
conventions, formats, and examples setup.
